## 🎯 Problem Statement

The sports card trading market is highly fragmented across platforms (eBay, Fanatics, PWCC, COMC, PSA Registry), creating significant operational overhead for dealers and collectors:

- **3-week lag** for professional card scans from Fanatics
- Manual photo cropping and uploading across multiple platforms
- Platform-specific auction mechanics requiring constant monitoring
- No unified pricing strategy across marketplaces
- Inefficient dealer-collector matching at large conventions

This platform addresses these pain points through intelligent automation and unified platform architecture.
